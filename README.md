## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about semantic HTML5 markup. For example that the <article> tag and the <section> tag are interchangeable and how/when each tag is used depends on the context. You might wrap a list of <article> together in a <section> tag to group them on a webpage or you might have an <article> tag with content that is divided by <section> as I have here in this project.

### Useful resources

I use these two sites all the time. They've come in handy for almost every project I've worked on.
